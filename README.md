# Data 542 Group 6 Project

# Introduction

This project uses various data sets from the AIDev project to answer three main questions.

1. Which coding language uses AI agents more often?
2. How does change complexity affect time to merge and acceptance rate of different AI agents?
3. How does human scrutiny change based on the AI agent making the pull request?

# Reports

The final reports is in the main directory, and the url to the GitHub can be found inside the report. There is also the proposal and the updated proposal to feedback in the main directory as well.

# Calculations

Inside the calculations folder are the files used for the report questions, if you have the necessary libraries to pull the AIDev set databases then it should just run fine sequentially. No large processing time was noticed when we ran the code ourselves.

# AI Use Disclosure

GenAI was used to check multiple parts of the code for question 3, especially the data wrangling part, and no where else.
