# Data 542 Group 6 Project

# Reports
The reports are in the main directory, and the url to the GitHub can be found inside the report.

# Calculations
Inside the calculations folder are the files used for the report questions, if you have the necessary libraries to pull the AIDev set databases then it should just run fine sequentially. No large processing time was noticed when I ran the code myself.
